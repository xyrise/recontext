## Project Brief
**ReconText is a chrome extension that provides additional context for the user's current reading through recon on related peer-reviewed papers.** To prevent readers from falling into algorithmically biased echo chamber, the extension offers diverse viewpoints and findings that may not otherwise be visible on advanced search engines highly tailored to the user's preexisting interests. Based on the keywords extracted from the webpage, scholarly articles are presented with a quick abstract and tagged with important subtopics. Furthermore, the current relevance of the subject is determined by the frequency of the publications per year, whether it's currently trending, gaining traction, stabling interest, losing traction, or needing attention. The papers can be shared with others to reinforce inclusivity or be saved for later reading. 

This chrome extension was built within 36 hours during 'Tartan Hacks 2022' hackathon.
